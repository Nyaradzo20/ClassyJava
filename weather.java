/**
 * A modern weather application built using JavaFX that fetches and displays weather data
 * from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to search for weather information
 * by city, view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, and toggle between
 * Celsius and Fahrenheit units. It also maintains a search history of the last five searches.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Fetches weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
 * - Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
 * - Supports unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
 * - Maintains a search history of up to five recent searches.
 * - Displays weather condition icons.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Enter a city name in the input field and click "Search" to fetch weather data.
 * - Use the dropdown to toggle between Celsius (째C) and Fahrenheit (째F).
 * - View search history on the right panel.
 * 
 * Note:
 * - Replace the `API_KEY` with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
